# EMS
	Just my first hands on experience with .Net MVC Core CRUD application.

### Requirements to run the project
- `Visual Studio 2022` or later
- `SQLServer` as database
- And create the database named as `EMSDB`
- Create a table `Employees`, code given in `db/Employees.sql`
- Set the ConnectionString in `appsettings.json`
- Then you are good to go.
